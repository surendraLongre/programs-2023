1.Mod
2.Midsquare
3.Folding


1. Mod :>
	h(x)=(x%size)+1;  // its best if the size of the array is a prime number because it is only divisible by either 1 or number itself.
2. Midsquare:>
	h(x)=middle_digit_of(x^2);
				//it is also not a bad idea apply MOD after getting the result from this, cuz of size compensation.
3. Folding:>
	i) First we square the numbers, and then we partition them into a group of digits. for ex. for 123347, we partition as 12, 33, 47. Then we add them 12+33+47=92, now if 92 holds in the array index then we go with it else, we can again add 92 as 9+2=11. and then again if 11 is greater than array size then can add like 1+1=2;
	ii) We can even store strings like "ABC" as "65 66 67" as a one number then applying folding on this number.
